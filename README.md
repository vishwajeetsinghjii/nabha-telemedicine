# SIH25018 — Nabha Rural Telemedicine Platform

A complete, production-grade, offline-first telemedicine platform designed for rural healthcare delivery in India. Optimized for low-bandwidth networks, intermittent connectivity, ASHA field workers, doctors, patients, and health administrators.

---

## 1. What Was Built

- **PWA Frontend (`frontend/`)**: Lightweight HTML5/CSS3/Vanilla JS Progressive Web App with 100% offline capability powered by IndexedDB (`nabhaTelemedicine`), Service Worker (`service-worker.js`), multilingual translation engine (English, Hindi, Punjabi), and customized role portals for Patient, ASHA, Doctor, and Admin.
- **Node.js/Express REST Backend (`backend/`)**: Production REST API running on port 5000 (`pg` pool, JWT auth, RBAC, offline sync idempotency engine, PDF prescription generator, audit logging, and OpenAPI documentation).
- **Python FastAPI AI Microservice (`ai-service/`)**: Standalone AI service on port 8001 providing explainable rule-based clinical preliminary triage (`LOW`, `MODERATE`, `HIGH`, `EMERGENCY`) with clinical safety disclaimers and pytest test suite.
- **Background Worker Engine (`worker/`)**: Microservice job worker executing asynchronous task queues (PDF rendering, audit log archiving, sync status sweeps).
- **Local Health Center Gateway (`gateway/`)**: Network proxy component providing local WAN outage resilience for rural Primary Health Centers (PHC).
- **Database Engine (`database/`)**: PostgreSQL schema migrations (14+ tables, multi-center hierarchy, `patient_code` `NAB-XXXXXX`) and demo dataset seeds.

## 5. Local Execution Guide

### Step 1: Run Frontend Static Server (Port 8000)
```bash
cd frontend
python -m http.server 8000
```
Open **`http://localhost:8000/index.html`** in any browser.

### Step 2: Run Backend REST Server (Port 5000)
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm test
npm start
```
API root active at **`http://localhost:5000/api/v1`**, interactive Swagger docs at **`http://localhost:5000/api-docs`**.

### Step 3: Run Python FastAPI AI Microservice (Port 8001)
```bash
cd ai-service
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
```
Interactive FastAPI docs active at **`http://localhost:8001/docs`**.

---

## 6. Docker Deployment

Launch the multi-container stack (PostgreSQL + Node Backend + Python AI Service):
```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

---

## 7. Testing Results Overview

- **Backend Integration & Security Tests (`backend/`)**: 21 / 21 passed cleanly (`npm test`).
- **Python FastAPI AI Unit Tests (`ai-service/`)**: 5 / 5 passed cleanly (`pytest`).
- **Idempotency Verification**: Pushing duplicate `operationId` operations returns `{ idempotent: true, status: 'SYNCED' }` without creating duplicate records.

---

## 8. Prototype Disclaimer & Medical Safety Notice

This system is an engineering prototype developed for the SIH25018 Problem Statement. AI preliminary triage assessments are strictly labeled as **"AI-assisted preliminary triage ONLY"** and do not constitute a definitive diagnosis. Final clinical decisions belong to qualified medical professionals.
## Docker startup

Run from the repository root:

```powershell
docker compose up --build
```

The migration service is built from the repository root so it can access the canonical `database/migrations/` directory. It must complete successfully before the backend starts.

If you previously ran a failed migration container, rerun the same `docker compose up --build` command; Compose will recreate the migration service when its image changes.


## 4.0.1 production dashboard release
This release consolidates role dashboards, professional verification, private credential documents, notifications, audit history, appointment/consultation lifecycle hooks, dashboard timeout/retry handling, production fail-closed AI/video behavior, migration tracking, container health checks, and PostgreSQL backup tooling. See `docs/RELEASE_V4_0_0.md`.

## Consultation Workflow v5.0
Patient doctor selection is disabled. Patients submit consultation requests; active approved administrators assign doctors; assigned doctors accept requests; only then can the doctor start the consultation/video session. Clinical documentation is saved against the assigned appointment/request and is released to the patient when the consultation is completed. Every state transition creates notifications and an audit event.

## Consultation workflow (v5)

Patients do not select doctors. The controlled workflow is:

`Patient request -> Admin notification -> Admin assigns approved doctor -> Doctor accepts -> Doctor starts -> Patient joins -> Doctor records clinical notes -> Doctor completes -> Patient receives released clinical record`

The request, assignment, acceptance, start and completion states are persisted in the database and linked through `consultation_requests`, `appointments` and `consultations`.

See `docs/CONSULTATION_WORKFLOW.md` for the state machine and security rules.

Done..
